#### List of packages
**akf**: The purpose of akf package is to implement autoregressive Kalman Filtering (AKF) 

**analysis_tools**: The purpose of analysis_tools is to optimise and generate analysis for Livska
Kalman Filter on experimental scenarios indexed by (test_case, variation). 

**data_tools**: The purpose of data_tools is to load data and analyse data generated by any algorithm (LKFFB, AKF, LSF, GPR) for any scenario (test_case, variation) for linear measurement models

**gpr**: The purpose of gpr is to implement Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) using GPy.
At present, the kernel being testing is the Periodic Kernel.

**kf**: The purpose of kf package is to implement Livska Kalman Filtering (KF) for linear measurement records

**ls** The purpose of ls package is to return LSF Predictions using VFrey and SMavadia's LS Filter (statePredictions.py)

**qif**: The purpose of kqf package is to implement Quantised Kalman Filtering (QKF) using AKF dynamics and single shot qubit outcomes [WIP]

**plot_tools**: The purpose of plot_tools package is to generate data figures and completely reproduce all figures reported in manuscript; locally held at */home/riddhisw/Documents/2017/Scripts_Git/v0/NOTES_v0 _1/tex/fig_main/scripts*
